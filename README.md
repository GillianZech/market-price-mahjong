# market-price-mahjong
A riichi mahjong client where the more frequent a yaku is achieved, the fewer points the yaku is worth.

Every yaku's point value is at "market price," which is determined by the overall frequency the yaku is achieved in the history of Market Price Mahjong compared to all other yaku. The LOWER the frequency, the HIGHER its market price. For instance, if All Simples is achieved less often than Full Flush, then All Simples will have a higher market price and earn you more points than Full Flush, but play again later and All Simples might be more frequent, reducing its market price. Every yaku's market price will be available to you at all times and constantly fluctuating. Going for a high market price yaku will earn you the most points, but watch out - every time you earn a yaku, that yaku's market price is reduced!
